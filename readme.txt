Bargain me is a tool to scrape the pages of a popular auction website and report when a bargain is found.

I have this periodically searching the website for auctions matching a description that are under a price and within a closing date, then reporting those to me via email. Automate everything!

Uses sqlite to store already reported auctions. So it doesnt re-report auctions.
